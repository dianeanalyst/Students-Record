Task on creating database and understanding the basics of table formation in data analysis using Structured Query Language.
# Introduction
Working on this task is my first attempt on practicing data analysis Structured query language. This is a tool used to access, process/manipulate data stored in a relational database management system (RDBMS) and  it is called SQL for short. The practice here involved trying my hands on how to create a database, tables from scratch and inserting values into the tables.
