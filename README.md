# Students-Record
Task on creating database and understanding the basics of table formation in data analysis using Structured Query Language.
# Introduction
Working on this task is my first attempt on practicing data analysis using structured query language. This is a tool used to access, process/manipulate data stored in a relational database management system (RDBMS) and  it is called SQL for short. The practice here involved trying my hands on how to create  database and tables from scratch and inserting values into the tables.
# Skills demonstrated and activity
In the course of carrying out this task, the activities required that I show some SQL data modification skills and make use of key SQL statements like CREATE, SELECT, ALTER and INSERT INTO which further makes me understand the likely use cases for each statement. A database and three tables were created with named columns with some activities to modify the tables created. The list below shows what was required to fulfil this task.
#
- Create a databse names "Students Record"
#
- Create the following lisetd tables and column headers in the database created
#
a.  Students Info (Student_ID, Gender, Name, Age, Subject)
#
b.  Health Records (Student ID, Blood Group, Height, Weight)
#
c.  Performance (Student ID, Score, Grade)
#
- The ID has to be unique
- Where a student has no score, it should be '0' by default
- Add a constraint that prevents the ID and Subject from taking null values
- Apply the following modifications to the table
  1. Change column name "Subject" to "Course".
  2. Drop the "Age" column from the Students Info table.
# Solution
I started by creating a database named
